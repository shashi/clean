Alright. Let’s get this over with. Visit ANY popular game review site on this Sid Meier’s Civilized Earth, and not a fucking sight of a Defense of the Ancients feature on it. Not one. All these years I spent playing the Warcraft III mod DotA I never once thought it was unusual that sites like IGN, PC Gamer, Game-stop weren’t mentioning it.
You probably guessed right. I play DotA. A lot. I’ve been playing it for three years and it doesn’t look like I’ll be quitting any time soon. But now DotA clones are everywhere! THEY MUST BE EXAMINED. But first: a little musing on the intricacies of DotA, the first, the best.
</p>
<p>
After Arjun coaxed me into writing this, I started figuring out the thought process required, a structure for this article, I had merely planned on educating the ignorant masses about the wonderful creation of art that is DotA. I looked up some figures on the internet. According to DotA’s longest serving designer, Icefrog, not counting China, 7-11 million people were playing it in 2010. That’s three years ago, and not including China. That is how huge it is. Believe it or not, DotA is relevant now; it has spawned a whole new genre referred to by the ugly term ‘MOBA’ (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena – ugh). We’re talking Heroes of Newerth, League of Legends, and Bloodline Champions. When I used to talk about ‘ganking’ and ‘farming’ no one used to know what the hell I was talking about and now I feel positively embittered that everyone is trying to tell me what a great idea doing those things is.

</p>
<p>
Allow me a small pause to feel disappointed in my fellow gamers.

</p>
<p>
Why didn’t anyone duck in for a few war stories? What’s everyone been doing? I asked around. I asked every gamer I know:  Why haven’t you played DotA before now? Everyone else’s been obsessing over it for years, including myself. Hell, I am so obsessed with DotA I haven’t done any creative writing since the year 2010. And I love writing! Let me tell you what happened exactly. I didn’t ‘get time’ to write. It would have gotten all up in my DotA. Fuck creative writing, I do the bare minimum for my abhorrently boring Civil Engineering course (yes, I’m entitled to an opinion), finish assignments in half an hour the day before the deadline, study for tests only hours before and never, I mean ‘never’ attend classes which don’t threaten me with an FA. After which I bugger off to the woods of Azeroth without having to regret even a single moment, farming creeps all day and running around in the enemy base like a weasel on acid. What was everyone else who liked games doing with their time, I wondered? Not playing DotA? That’s absurd. Pathetic even.

</p>
<p>
The answer is: my friends, the ‘proper’ student gamers were appalled, that’s why. Appalled at what you ask me? DotA sucking up my time or inclination to write/study I would say. They are gamers too, some may argue. BUT, they were finishing games and moving on. Hell, my fellow student in Kota, Rajasthan who is as dim as an un-plugged light-bulb, managed to become the rock star of his college, whilst I was engaged in hours of having ‘M-M-M-MONSTER KILL!’ screamed down my earholes. I sound like I am describing an addiction: I am. It has set me back several years, at least in my mind it has. Let me get back to the part where I was saying how ‘other’ gamers finish ‘other’ games and move on. There is no ‘finishing’ DotA. You have to invest yourself in DotA to get something good from it. And once you invest in it, you never really leave the need to play it behind. It’s like the mafia. Once you are in, you are in it forever. Life just ‘made you an offer you can’t refuse.’

</p>
<p>
You get obsessed at getting better at DotA, though you will never be good. You get obsessed with the long game. You get obsessed with tactics. You invest your whole being into it in order for that one, giant payoff win at the end. You are questing for an elusive victory. And it happens little enough that it is like that beautiful, head banging, bass guitar playing perfect girl (who listens to heavy metal)  you can’t have, the one who never looks at you, the one who always talks to the other guy, the one who just won’t come round…

</p>
<p>
But you still want her… The DotA victory is a fucking tease. Like the hot girl who reclines at the back of the club, daring you to think you can have her. When you do finally, after plying her with all your wiles, actually attain her, it’s so damn good you want it again – oh – immediately. But she’s left without giving you her number. And she stood on your glasses on the way out. They were your good pair as well: the Polo Ralph Lauren ones that made you look like Johnny Depp. You put on your other pair and look in the mirror to see that you look like Skrillex. The next victory seems somewhat far off. But let me tell you something. The satisfaction, and ultimately, addiction to DotA comes from the return on the complex investments DotA asks of you. Let me simplify it for you. It’s the thrill of the chase! It’s like those little intricacies work themselves electric into your nervous system until you can feel them crackle on your fingertips. DotA is far bigger than any single one of us.
</p>
<p>

    It’s no more, or less, than an electric Valhalla…
</p>
<p>

The first investment is in a little knowledge of how the game works. DotA separates players into two teams of five, and each team’s goal is to destroy the other’s base, specifically the building in the centre of the base to end the game victorious. Each player picks one of just over 100 different heroes with special abilities (based on intelligence, agility, or strength skills), and strides forth to do battle on one of three lanes. ‘Creeps’ (Your little minion dudes with not much health) spawn at your base and make their way down the lanes towards the enemy base. Your job, as a hero, is to help them total all the towers on the lanes and finally get into the enemy base to win. But the other heroes are there, and they can seriously kill your noob ass, your mom and her courier! For gold and experience. And it’s the same with creeps: you can ‘farm’ enemy creeps and become strong and powerful by making your hero exorbitantly more decorated with booty than the Queen at a coronation. By the end of the game you’re like Snoop Dogg, swaggering around with so much loot in your pockets your trousers are around your ankles!
</p>
<p>

The heroes are magnificent: not only are they dramatically different from each other, crackling with neon spells, terribly voice-acted puns and grinning at you from their talking avatar, they each must be delicately tuned, as if they were guitars – but guitars who murder. Take the Tinker character, for example. He’s a cute little steam punk goblin with a mechanical frame
</p>
<p>

       

attached to him that runs about adorably. His little laser ability might seem cute, before he targets you in the face after which it looks like your face caught on fire and someone tried to put it out with a fork. His mechanical goblin army might seem lovely from afar, until they rain down on you like a mini robot hell, eradicating creeps, your health bar and your motivation to ever play DotA again. Try to run away – you’re almost back to base now – and the Tinker will re-arm all his abilities and launch a heat-seeking missile to take whatever is left of your miserable life. MEGAKILL!
</p>
<p>

Not so cute now, huh?
</p>
<p>

The second investment you make is in time. Games of DotA usually take 30 minutes if one team is awful, an hour if you’re all right, and much, much longer, if you’re pretty damn good and really well matched. Or, if you want to prolong someone’s pain, which *smirk sadistically*, I admit to doing one too many times to players who have been rude in the early game. That means your entire evening will be sucked into a void once you embark on a game: because if you lose, and you likely will, you’ll want to play again to win. After four matches, it’s like no time has passed at all and you haven’t even won a game. But four hours have gone by and the dinner you ordered from NC is congealing insolently on your desk. A small line of ants has formed to it. The ants are marching over your lap and the Queen Ant has set up shop at your crotch.
</p>
<p>

Time with the game also buys you something: Instinct. After hours and hours of DotA, you develop a Spider Sense! You’re way out killing creeps at a tower, and all of the opposition are hidden by the fog of war: something galls you. You run. Five seconds later, all your baffled enemy heroes appear where you just were. You thank your ‘Boots of Speed’ you left just in time, or you’d be a spell-mangled gibbering mess by now. Or, if the opposition disappear for too long, it’s likely they’re away killing Roshan (I love this reference to India!), the game’s most revered NPC, for his treasure which gives you Immortality!  If you play enough DotA, intuition will raise startling alarms using which you can alert your team, go ambush them, smugly, and steal their prize.
</p>
<p>

Spend enough time, and you’ll sense things. You’ll know when you are in trouble before it happens. You’ll know when you can stay or run. You just get to know. There are not many games you play where you can claim a hunch lead to you winning – but DotA is one of them. You also need to allow yourself time to be really bad at DotA for a while. You will suck. You will not be good at this game. I am not good at it, and at the height of my addiction I was probably playing DotA every single day for four hours. But being good is not the point, and anyone who tells you different is a <TBSB considers this term under the category ‘profane’ – for a full description, however, click here> and you should ban him from the server (“GET GUD NOOB!” Whatever – REPORTED). You can be the worst player on the team and still contribute to an explicitly stunning win. You’re only as good as how well your team works together, and that’s all that counts…
</p>
<p>

…Which is your third investment: your team!  In many ways, this is the most important thing about DotA. It is also the one single reason why I love DotA. Spark of fire, intricacies of the complex, fluidity of liquid, force of One Team! There are few things in the world that will plunge you into a really intense hour-long situation where you rely upon someone else doing their absolute best for you every moment they are there whilst you try your utmost to do the same, where if you do it right you both have the time of your lives! Unless you count sex, but in my experience sex is never anything as long as an hour, and isn’t nearly as enjoyable. Also, unless you are extremely lucky, you don’t get to do it with four other people at the same time. And yet, and yet, a win in DotA is more elusive than the female orgasm. Trust me on this one.
</p>
<p>

No. The closest good simile for DotA is that it is like a delicate machine to emphasize comradeship in war. You go to battle depending on, and looking after your friends. You might even come to like them more than you did before, and get to know them better. People’s personalities come through as they play, you get to know who will run in to save you in a fight and who will run in and die if you don’t assist. This is how I have found my friends. And because of this, I know that I can bank on them to save my ass every time I go ‘Hail Mary’ on an opponent Crystal Maiden. You warn each other, coordinate ambushes (affectionately referred to as ‘ganks’) and yell when an enemy hero is missing from your lane. You ask each other which items would be good for the team: you debate the finer points whilst working your own small corner of the map, a cog in a beautiful intricate mechanism (Mekansm, some might say!). If you listen carefully during a game, sometimes you can feel the willpower of your teammates positively striving for a win. Or, perhaps that is just someone having his “happy time” to the Queen of Pain’s moans? I can never tell.
</p>
<p>


Akasha – The Queen of Pain – My one true love
I think there is another investment that you slowly make. It might be a side effect of having a regular team you play with. It is the emotional investment. An investment in intimacy. When I first started playing DotA, I’d just met a whole new group of friends who all played games. I guess it was the first time I felt like I belonged. I was ready to fully immerse myself in a pool of people who were exactly as nerdy as me. I found them.  And you grow to love that you can play it like it’s Sunday afternoon football. It’s just a forum for chitchat punctuated with excitement at a kill (“HAHA! Delete DotA, Noob!”) or exclamations of profanity (“STFU NOOB, STOP FEEDING”). Once you’re over that learning hump, you find the need to constantly talk tactics – once you know which tactic you’re playing, it’s like watching a film that you’re all taking part in, and talking over it. It’s like making your own Mystery Theatre 3000. And it makes you happy that you can share that with people. It makes you closer to them. DotA’s like a cement that holds you together. It’s like a fraternity with a very strict set of rules, and at least twenty games’ worth of hazing and giggling about how you can’t stack Power Treads until someone grins and says gently, “Good work.” The quiet glory you feel electrifies. It makes you love the world. Electric fucking Valhalla.
</p>
<p>

Now I feel like a DotA hipster. I’ve gone headfirst back into DotA 2 and it’s still addictive – I just feel strange. I feel old when people new to the game talk DotA 2 tactics. I feel like I have already lived through decades of the team chat in-game back and forth and arguments, debates over who can counter who, what items would be best, when we should push a lane. When I see my juniors/new friends do this now I feel a lot like this:
</p>
<p>

                                                   

Traumatised. Old. Slightly weary. I also get twinges of this:
</p>
<p>

       

You know the sort. The, “I have seen things in the original DotA that you people wouldn’t believe. I have seen Wind runner attack Goblin Techies off the bank of the upper river and die; I have seen heroes on fire off the shoulder of the Tree of Life. I watched spells glitter in the dark near the enemy base. All those moments are lost in battle, like… items off a courier in an AOE nuke.” I am being dramatic. But there is something there in the format of DotA 2 that wants to pull me back. Like the returning soldier trying to adjust to civilian life, I remember the bad days but the highs and camaraderie are second to none. In the real world I want to use all the old terms. If we get late in Mangalore I will still wish we had a town portal scroll so I can teleport back home. I’ll go to the shops on the road side and watch my back for ganks. I’ll forget my umbrella and want to know where the courier chicken is. I am late for class and I wish for Anti-Mage’s blink. Or Rikimaru’s permanent invisibility with which I can finally keep to myself and enjoy the soliloquy I have been wanting for an eternity.
</p>
<p>

DotA has left behind a legacy, and I am going to examine it. A few years from now, when I look back upon these four years I spent at NITK, the first thing I would be glad about is the day ^rebellion^ introduced me to the way of life called DotA. I will not regret the fact that by taking up a serious interest in DotA I sacrificed a 9+ CGPA. No, I will not tell you that I wronged. Maybe, one day when you ever get the opportunity to truly appreciate the phenomenon that DotA is, you’ll know what I… No… what we have understood. bLITZ, ^rebellion^, Dante, Paradox and Building! Once a Nature’s Bitch. Always a Nature’s Bitch!

</p>
<p>
I feel I have already taken a lot of space and time here. There’s so much more I want to talk about. Maybe some other time then.

</p>
<p>
Half of everything in DotA is sensing where you shouldn’t be. I’m going to carry that with me and see where it takes me. You should come! It’ll be fun.

</p>
<p>
Until next time, heroes.
